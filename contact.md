## Connect with us on GitHub

We welcome input from federal agency staff and others who are involved in creating and managing federal websites. 

### Project board

We maintain a public [project board on GitHub for standards](https://github.com/orgs/GSA-TTS/projects/48/views/1?filterQuery=label%3A%22Potential+standard%22). You can see the standards we're working on and provide your input. 

### Website repository

We have a public [repository for the standards website on GitHub](https://github.com/GSA-TTS/federal-website-standards). You can [make suggestions for the site or file a bug report](https://github.com/GSA-TTS/federal-website-standards/issues/new/choose) if you find an issue.

### Discussions

We're testing [GitHub discussions as a place to discuss the standards](https://github.com/GSA-TTS/federal-website-standards/discussions). Federal agency staff and other stakeholders can participate in discussions, ask questions, or propose ideas.
