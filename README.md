# Federal website standards (DRAFT)

This repo is for federal website standards for executive branch federal agencies in the U.S. We’re developing standards to help agencies provide high-quality, consistent digital experiences for everyone. The standards will align with the requirements of the [21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/5759/text) and with [OMB’s memo on Delivering a Digital-First Public Experience (M-23-22)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/management/ofcio/delivering-a-digital-first-public-experience/). 

[Suggest an improvement to the website or file a bug report](https://github.com/GSA-TTS/federal-website-standards/issues/new/choose) if you find an issue.
