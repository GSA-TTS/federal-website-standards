# Federal website standards

This repo is for prototyping federal website standards for executive branch federal agencies. 

Federal website standards are evidence-based actions that will help agencies:
- Meet the publicâ€™s evolving expectations for digital experiences
- Reduce the burden of researching, designing, and developing core web components
- Participate in communities of practice around standards implementation

Federal website standards will help us deliver a high-quality, digital-first experience for the public.
