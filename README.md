# Federal web standards

This repo is for prototyping federal web standards for executive branch federal agencies. 

Federal web standards are evidence-based requirements that will help agencies:
- Meet the publicâ€™s evolving expectations for digital experiences
- Reduce the burden of researching, designing, and developing core web components
- Participate in communities of practice around standards implementation

Federal web standards will help us deliver a high-quality, digital-first experience for the public.
