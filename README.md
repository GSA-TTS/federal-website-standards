# Federal website standards (DRAFT)

This repo is for federal website standards for U.S. executive branch federal agencies. We’re developing standards to help agencies provide high-quality, consistent digital experiences for everyone. The standards will align with the [21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/5759/text) and with [OMB’s memo on Delivering a Digital-First Public Experience (M-23-22)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/management/ofcio/delivering-a-digital-first-public-experience/). 

This site relies on the following tools: 
- [Cloud.gov Pages](https://cloud.gov/pages/) publishing platform
- [Digital Analytics Program](https://digital.gov/guides/dap/)
- [Search.gov](https://search.gov/)
- [U.S. Web Design System (USWDS)](https://designsystem.digital.gov/)
- [11ty static site generator](https://www.11ty.dev/) and the [11ty USWDS template](https://github.com/cloud-gov/pages-uswds-11ty)
