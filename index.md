**Deliver a high-quality, digital-first experience for the public**

The public primarily interacts with the federal government through digital channels. More than five hundred million users visit executive branch federal sites each month, increasingly from mobile devices. 

Agencies should ensure their websites, including web applications, digital services, and mobile applications, are meeting user needs by adhering to best practices and implementing the federal web standards. Together, we can design and deliver a high-quality, integrated digital experience that is simple, seamless, and secure across agencies for all users.

## What are federal web standards?

Federal web standards are evidence-based requirements that will help agencies:
- Meet the public’s evolving expectations for digital experiences
- Reduce the burden of researching, designing, and developing core web components
- Participate in communities of practice around standards implementation
