title: Deliver a high-quality, consistent digital-first experience for the public
---

The public primarily interacts with the federal government through digital channels. More than five hundred million users visit executive branch federal sites each month, increasingly from mobile devices.

Agencies should ensure their websites, including web applications, digital services, and mobile applications, are meeting user needs by adhering to best practices and implementing the federal website standards. The standards will help us deliver high-quality, consistent digital experiences for the public.


## What are federal website standards?

The standards are evidence-based actions that will help federal agencies:

- Meet the publicâ€™s evolving expectations for digital experiences
- Reduce the burden on agencies to research and design core web components
- Prioritize and plan web design and development projects
