title: Deliver consistent, digital-first experiences for the public
---

Most people interact with the federal government online. Each month, more than 500 million users visit federal websites, with more and more doing so from their mobile devices.

To serve the public better, agencies should make sure their websites, apps, and online services are easy to use and meet people's needs. By following federal website standards, we can provide high-quality, consistent digital experiences for everyone.


## What are federal website standards?

The standards are evidence-based actions that will help federal agencies:

- Meet the publicâ€™s evolving expectations for digital experiences
- Reduce the burden on agencies to research and design core web components
- Prioritize and plan web design and development projects
