title: Deliver consistent, digital-first experiences for the public
---

Most people interact with the federal government online. Each month, more than 500 million users visit federal websites, with more and more doing so from their mobile devices. (Visit [analytics.usa.gov](http://analytics.usa.gov) for more data on how people interact with the government online.)

Websites, apps, and online services offered by federal agencies should be easy to use and effective. By following federal website standards, we can provide high-quality, consistent digital experiences for everyone.

## What are federal website standards?

The standards will describe how agencies can offer a more consistent, high-quality user experience for the public. The [21st Century IDEA](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/5759/text) instructs agencies to maintain as much standardization and commonality with other agencies as practicable in implementing the requirements of the Act. Increased standardization and cross-government collaboration reduce government-wide implementation costs and ensure a more consistent digital experience for the public. 

The standards are evidence-based actions that will help federal agencies:
- Meet the public’s evolving expectations for digital experiences
- Reduce the burden on agencies to research and design core web components
- Prioritize and plan web design and development projects

## When will federal agencies be required to comply with these standards? 

Published standards are required, per [OMB’s memo on delivering a digital-first public experience](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/M-23-22-Delivering-a-Digital-First-Public-Experience.pdf). Draft standards are in review and are expected to be required in the future. 

## What standards are being considered?

We’ll post draft standards to this site as they’re being developed so you can follow their progress. For more insight into this work, visit the [standards roadmap on Github](https://github.com/orgs/GSA-TTS/projects/48/views/1?filterQuery=label%3A%22Potential+standard%22).
