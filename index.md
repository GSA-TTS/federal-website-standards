title: Deliver consistent, digital-first experiences for the public
description: Federal website standards will help agencies provide high-quality, consistent experiences for everyone. Comply with standards to improve your federal site.
---

Most people interact with the federal government online. Websites, apps, and online services offered by federal agencies should be easy to use and effective. We’re developing federal website standards to help agencies provide high-quality, consistent digital experiences for everyone. 

The [21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/5759/text) instructs agencies to maintain as much standardization and commonality with other agencies as practicable in implementing the requirements of the Act. Increased standardization and cross-government collaboration reduce government-wide implementation costs and ensure a more consistent digital experience for the public. 

## Standards will be released incrementally

The standards will be developed through a deliberative process that involves research with the public and with agency staff. We’ll continuously improve the standards to help agencies meet evolving best practices and user expectations. 

## Federal agencies should plan to implement pending standards 

Per the [Office of Management and Budget memo on delivering a digital-first public experience (PDF)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/M-23-22-Delivering-a-Digital-First-Public-Experience.pdf), agencies are required to comply with standards. This site includes pending standards that will be required and potential standards that are in development so you can follow their progress.
