description: Federal website standards will help agencies provide high-quality, consistent experiences for everyone. Comply with standards to improve your federal site.
---

Most people interact with the federal government online. Websites, apps, and online services offered by federal agencies should be easy to use and effective. We’re developing federal website standards to help agencies provide high-quality, consistent digital experiences for everyone. 

The standards will help agencies meet the requirements of the [21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/5759/text) and comply with the guidance provided by [OMB’s memo on Delivering a Digital-First Public Experience](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/management/ofcio/delivering-a-digital-first-public-experience/). 

## Standards will be released incrementally

The standards will be developed through a deliberative process that involves research with the public and with agency staff. We’ll continuously improve the standards to help agencies meet evolving best practices and user expectations. 

## Federal agencies should plan to comply with pending standards 

This site includes pending standards that will be required and potential standards that are in development so you can follow their progress.
