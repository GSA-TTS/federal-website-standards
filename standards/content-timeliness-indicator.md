## Standard

Inform users about the timeliness of content.

## Status

Research

## Why

Timeliness indicators can increase user trust in the currency and accuracy of information.

## Applies to

Public-facing websites of executive branch federal agencies

## Acceptance criteria

Include timeliness indicators on the following types of content:
- News, press releases
- Announcements, alerts
- Data, statistics
- Information that changes every year
- Policies, regulations, legal information
- Health information

## How to implement

- **Placement**: Put the timeliness indicator at the top or bottom of the page. Put the indicator in the same place on all pages of your site.
- **Format**: Use the full month name followed by the day and year as in this example: Updated June 27, 2024. The full month name is clearer than using an abbreviation or only numbers.

    - Published May 8, 2024
