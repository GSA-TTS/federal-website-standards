## Status

{% include "_includes/status/research.html" %}

## Standard

Inform users about the timeliness of content by including the date of publication, a last updated date, or a last reviewed date as relevant for your content and audience.

## Why

Timeliness indicators can increase user trust in the currency and accuracy of information.

## Research questions

Weâ€™re researching this potential standard. Research questions include:

- Do users have preferences for the language used (published, updated, or reviewed)? 
- Should the language be standardized by type of content? 
- Do users have preferences on the length of time between updates for certain types of content? 
- How do users respond to multiple dates (e.g., published and updated)?
