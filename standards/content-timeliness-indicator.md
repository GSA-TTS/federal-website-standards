## Status

{% include "_includes/status/draft.html" %}

## Standard

Inform users about the timeliness of content by including the date of publication, a last updated date, or a last reviewed date as relevant for your content and audience.

## Why

Timeliness indicators can increase user trust in the currency and accuracy of information.

## Applies to

Executive branch agency websites and digital services that are intended for use by the public

## Acceptance criteria

These conditions must be met to comply with this standard.

Include timeliness indicators on the following types of content:
- News, press releases
- Announcements, alerts
- Data, statistics
- Information that changes every year or information that is likely to change every year
- Policies, regulations, legal information
- Health information

## How to implement

These are tips to help you implement this standard.

- **Placement**: Put the timeliness indicator at the top or bottom of the page. Place the indicator in a consistent location on all pages of the same content type.
- **Format**: Use the full month name followed by the day and year as in this example: `Updated June 27, 2024`. The full month name is clearer than using an abbreviation or only numbers.
- **When to change the date**: Update the date if the content changes substantively. A substantive change is one that impacts the information in a way that is relevant to your audience.
- **Language**: Use plain language to specify when content was published, last updated, or last reviewed. Acceptable phrases include:
  - `Published May 8, 2024`
  - `Updated June 12, 2024`
  - `Reviewed July 1, 2024`

### Timeliness indicator options for types of content
