## Standard

Summarize the content of the page in the meta description tag. The description should be unique and include key information about the page content.

## Why

The meta description supports accessibility and discoverability. The meta description will often appear in search results pages instead of a snippet of page content. The description, along with the [HTML page title](../html-page-title), helps a person decide whether or not to click a search result.

## How to implement

- Follow the U.S. Web Design System (USWDS) guidance on meta page descriptions. 
- Include a description in the `<meta name=”description”>` tag for every page of your website. The `<meta name=”description”>` tag is part of the `<head>` section of a web page.
- Page descriptions should summarize the content of a page. Descriptions should be written in plain language and include the most important information.
- Try to keep descriptions to 160 characters or fewer. Longer descriptions often get truncated on search results pages. 


## Examples

These examples show the HTML code for meta page descriptions.

```<meta name="description" content="Find out how to check the status of certain VA claims, decision reviews, or appeals online.">```
        
```<meta name="description" content="Learn steps you can take to lower your risk for health problems from high blood pressure, such as heart disease and stroke."/>```
