## Standard

Use the federal government banner at the top of every page to identify your site as an official federal government site.

{% image "_img/banner.png" "Federal government banner for a .gov site with drop-down expanded" %}

## Status

Standard

## Why

The banner identifies official websites of government organizations in the United States. The banner helps people understand that the website is official and secure. The banner includes a drop-down with text options appropriate for your .gov or .mil domain. The banner is one of the most recognizable design elements on federal websites.

## Applies to

Public-facing websites of executive branch federal agencies using .gov or .mil domains

## Acceptance criteria

- The federal government banner must be at the top of every page of your site.
- The banner must appear on a line by itself.
- The banner design, text, and image should not be customized. [Use the current design, text, and image provided by the U.S. Web Design System (USWDS)](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/banner/). 
- The banner implementation must include the following elements as specified by USWDS:
    - U.S. flag image
    - Text that identifies an official U.S. government site
    - Drop-down component with:
      - Text that identifies an official .gov or .mil domain
      - Text that describes HTTPS connections
     
Agencies are encouraged to [use the USWDS banner component to meet this standard](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/banner/). If youâ€™re using another design system, you still need to meet these criteria.
