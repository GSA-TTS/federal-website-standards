## Standard

Identify links to external sites clearly and consistently.

## Why

Informing users when a link will take them to a different site helps them decide whether or not to click that link. 

## Research questions

We’re researching this potential standard. Research questions include:
- Would consistent labeling of external links on federal government sites be valuable for users?
- How should an external link be defined? How do users define it? Should it be any link that takes users off the current site, or any link that takes users off a .gov site?
- Do users notice and understand the external link icon?
- How do users interpret textual indicators that a link will take them away from the current site (e.g., [Get started with Search.gov](https://search.gov/get-started/), [How to write meta descriptions [Google.com]](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/snippet#meta-descriptions))?
- Should this standard include guidance on when a link should open in a new window?
