## Standard

Use a descriptive, unique, and concise HTML page title for every page of your website.

## Status

Draft

## Why

A descriptive page title is important for accessibility and discoverability. People rely on page titles to understand the contents of a page and how it’s different from other pages. HTML page titles appear at the top of a browser tab. They’re often the first item read by screen readers when visiting a web page. HTML page titles are often used by search engines as the link to your web page from search results.

## Applies to

Public-facing websites of executive branch federal agencies

## How to implement

- Specify a title in the HTML `<title>` element for every page of your website. The `<title>` element is part of the `<head>` section in the web page HTML code.
- Titles should be descriptive, unique, and concise. Try to keep titles to between 50 and 60 characters. Titles that are too short might not be descriptive enough and titles that are too long might be truncated on search results pages.
- Provide context for visitors by including the site, product, service, or agency this page is part of in your HTML page title.

## Examples
