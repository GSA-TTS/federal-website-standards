## Standard

Public-facing websites must contain a search function that allows users to easily search content intended for public use. 

## Why

Search is a basic and universal part of using the internet, and search functionality is an expected feature for websites and digital services. 

## Applies to

Public-facing websites of executive branch federal agencies

## Acceptance criteria

- Every website must include a search function.
- The search function must be available from the upper right corner of the page on a desktop view.
- The search function must be in the same place on every page of your site.

## How to implement

- Use [Search.gov](http://Search.gov) for on-site search solutions, or make sure your site can be indexed by Search.gov.
- Follow the [U.S. Web Design System (USWDS) guidance on search](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/search/).
- The search function should be a site-wide global search. When appropriate for your users, the search feature could search subsets of content (e.g., help, blog, videos).
