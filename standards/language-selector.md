## Status

{% include "_includes/status/research.html" %}

## Standard

Help users easily find content in the language they prefer by providing consistent access to an effective language selector on multilingual websites.

## Why

Language selectors that follow best practices significantly improve the user experience by helping people access content in their preferred language on multilingual websites. 

## Research questions

We’re researching this potential standard. Research questions include:
- What’s the most effective way to help users find their preferred language on desktop and mobile (text, icon, browser language, etc.)?
- How should the number of languages offered impact the language selector?
- What order makes sense to users when there are many languages (alphabetized by English name, by non-Latin script, etc.)
- Where should the language selector be in relation to other utilities (e.g., login, search)?
- What should the role of the language selector be when only selected content is available in multiple languages?
