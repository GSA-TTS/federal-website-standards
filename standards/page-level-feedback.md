## Status

## Standard

Collect page-level content feedback on federal websites.

## Why

Allowing users to report content issues helps agencies identify potentially outdated, inaccurate, or unclear content, ensuring that government websites are accurate, user-friendly, and up-to-date. 

## Research questions

Weâ€™re researching this potential standard. Research questions include:
- How are agencies currently collecting and using page-level content feedback?
- What level of standardization is needed for successful implementation across federal websites?
- How do users expect to interact with page-level content feedback mechanisms?
- How can agencies balance standardization with flexibility based on their unique needs?
- What challenges do agencies face in implementing feedback mechanisms, and how can these challenges be addressed?
- How might expanding feedback to all pages affect user engagement and agency processes?
- What role does the feedback play, and how do agencies currently use it to improve content?
- How can agencies mitigate spam in feedback responses?
- Is the page-level feedback component sufficient for agencies to gather all the necessary information about a website? Does it address the questions a web manager might have if they receive a 'no'?
- What questions, if any, would further aid agencies in researching this standard?
