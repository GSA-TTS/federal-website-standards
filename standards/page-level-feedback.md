## Status

## Standard

Collect page-level content feedback on federal websites.

## Why

Collecting feedback from users on content issues helps agencies identify potentially outdated, inaccurate, or confusing content, ensuring that government websites are up-to-date, accurate, and user-friendly.

## Research questions

- How are agencies currently collecting and using page-level content feedback?
- What level of standardization is needed for successful implementation across federal websites?
- How do users expect to interact with page-level content feedback mechanisms?
- How can agencies balance standardization with flexibility based on their unique needs?
- What challenges do agencies face in implementing feedback mechanisms, and how can these challenges be addressed?
- How could page-level content feedback mechanisms be used alongside other feedback mechanisms (e.g., post-transaction)?
- How might expanding feedback to all pages affect user engagement and agency processes?
- What questions, if any, would further aid agencies in researching this standard?
