## Status

{% include "_includes/status/research.html" %}

## Standard

Every website must include a contact page. Every web page or screen must link to your contact page. Your contact page must include all contact options for your agency, product, or service.

## Why

Contact information that is easily and consistently accessible enables people to ask questions, give feedback, or get help with minimal obstacles. Contact pages that are informative, comprehensive, and accessible build trust and credibility.

## Research questions

Weâ€™re researching this potential standard. Research questions include:
- Where do users expect to find contact information on a page on desktop and mobile?
- Are users able to find the contact link as easily in the header, footer, or mobile menu?
- What kind of contact information do users expect to see (at a minimum)?
