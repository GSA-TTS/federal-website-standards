## Status

Research

## Why

Timeliness indicators can increase user trust in the currency and accuracy of information.

## Research questions

Weâ€™re researching this potential standard. Research questions include:

- Do users have preferences for the language used (published, updated, or reviewed)? 
- Should the language be standardized by type of content? 
- Do users have preferences on the length of time between updates for certain types of content? 
- How do users respond to multiple dates (e.g., published and updated)?

If you have research findings to share let us know at website.standards@gsa.gov or [join a discussion on Github about content timeliness](https://github.com/GSA-TTS/federal-website-standards/discussions/188).
