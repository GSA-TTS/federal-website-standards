Federal website standards help us deliver high-quality, consistent digital experiences for the public.

The standards are evidence-based actions that help federal agencies:
- Meet the publicâ€™s evolving expectations for digital experiences
- Reduce the burden on agencies to research and design core web components
- Prioritize and plan web design and development projects
