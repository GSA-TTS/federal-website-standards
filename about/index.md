Federal website standards will help agencies provide high-quality, consistent digital experiences for everyone. The standards cover visual and technical elements that reflect user experience best practices.

Federal agencies are required to comply with website standards per the [21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act (IDEA)](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/5759/text). Standards will align with the 21st Century IDEA and [OMB’s memo on Delivering a Digital-First Public Experience (M-23-22)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/management/ofcio/delivering-a-digital-first-public-experience/). 

## Status of the standards on this site

We’ll publish information about standards as they're being developed. Each standard will have a status to indicate where it is in the process. 

- **Research**: This standard is being researched with the public, federal agencies, and other stakeholders.
- **Draft**: This standard has been drafted and is being shared with federal agencies and other stakeholders.
- **Pending**: This standard has been finalized and will be required after a specified period of time following its initial publication. Agencies can begin working to comply with pending standards.
- **Required**: Federal agencies must comply with this standard.

## How the standards are developed

The standards are developed through an iterative process involving federal agencies, the public, and other stakeholders.

### OMB

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) sets the policy and conducts oversight for federal websites. 

### General Services Administration

GSA’s Technology Transformation Services (TTS) works with OMB to develop standards that align with OMB policies. TTS manages standards development and publication through the Federal Website Standards program. 

The [21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/5759/text) states that “Any website of an executive agency that is made available to the public after the date of enactment of this Act shall be in compliance with the website standards of the Technology Transformation Services of the General Services Administration.”

### Digital Experience Council (DX Council)

The [DX Council](https://digital.gov/resources/an-introduction-to-the-digital-experience-council/) is a cross-agency group that supports government-wide efforts to deliver a digital-first public experience. The DX Council provides feedback on potential standards and advises the Federal Website Standards program office.

### Standards development workflow

Federal website standards go through a rigorous workflow as described below. 

#### Research

For a potential standard to be considered, we must have evidence that the recommended action would improve the public’s user experience. If implemented by agencies, this action should result in a more consistent digital experience across federal websites. Evidence could be based on industry best practices and/or user research.

#### Draft and iterate

If we find evidence that implementing a standard will improve the public’s user experience across federal websites, we draft the standard. During this phase we share the draft with OMB, the DX Council, and other stakeholders. The draft standard will likely go through several iterations. The Standards team conducts usability testing sessions with agency staff and iterates as needed. 

#### Approve and publish

The next steps are to approve and publish the standard to this website. Standards are formally approved by TTS and OMB. Standards are published by TTS.

#### Revise

To revise a standard, the revision must be shown to improve the public user experience of agency websites or to improve the clarity of the standard. Revisions could be prompted by new technologies or changes in user behavior.

#### Withdraw

If we find evidence that a standard should be withdrawn, we draft a justification. We share the justification with OMB, the DX Council, and other stakeholders. The next steps are to withdraw and archive the standard. Withdrawals are formally approved by TTS and OMB. Standards are removed by the TTS Federal Website Standards program office.
